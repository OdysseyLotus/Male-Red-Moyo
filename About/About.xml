	<description>Adds male Red Moyo.

Now this one is a long time in the making, and by that I mean I finished it a long time ago but I don't like making preview images so I put it off until now. But hey, it is finally here! Now I can stop feeling bad for not releasing it and I can move on to other projects. If you want to play with Male Moyo, you're in luck, because that mod will be released side-by-side with this mod!

I added a male body type to the Red Moyo, so now you can have male and female Red Moyo. Since I felt like there was enough hairstyles, I didn't add any in this mod.

I have added appropriate male versions to all of the apparel. If you want male apparel of Moyo-The cartel arrives or the Dragonian apparel, you'll have to download the Male Moyo mod.

If there are any other alien races you want me to add males to, let me know and I might devote some time to creating those assets and patches as well.</description>
